NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite::Backend::Redis - Redis-driven storage
    backend for Throttle-Lite

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This is implemetation of the storage backend for
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite. It uses redis-server to hold
    throttling data, automatically sets expiration time for stored keys to
    save memory consumption.

SYNOPSYS
        # inside your app.psgi
        enable 'Throttle::Lite',
            backend => [
                'Redis' => {
                    server   => 'redis.example.com:6379',
                    database => 1,
                    password => 'VaspUtnuNeQuiHesGapbootsewWeonJadacVebEe'
                }
            ];

  redis
    Returns a redis connection handle.

  rdb
